**Data Visualization :**
        -> It is the graphical representation of the information and data.
        -> It is a quick,easy way to convey concepts in a universal manner.
        -> Visual elements like charts,graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends,outliers, and patterns in data

**Types of Data Visualization in Python :**
        -> Matplotlib: low level , provides lots of freedom
        -> Pandas Visualization : easy to use interface, built on Matplotlib
        -> Seaborn : High-level interface, great default styles
        -> ggplot : based on R's ggplot2, uses Grammer of Graphics
        -> Ploty : can create interavtive plots

**What is Matplotlib ?**
        -> It is a plotting library for the python prigramming language and its numerical mathematics extension Numpy.
        -> It is a python library used for Data Visualization.
        -> It is 2D and 3D plotting python library.
        -> It was introduced by john hunter in the year 2002.

**Matplotlib Graphs :**
        -> Linear Plot
        -> Scatter Plot
        -> Bar Plot
        -> Stem Plot
        -> Step Plot
        -> Hist Plot
        -> Box Plot
        -> Pie Plot
        -> Fill_Between Plot
        -> etc.

**Installation of Marplotlib :** " pip install matplotlib "

**Importing Matplotlib :** " import maatplotlib.pypplot as plt"
